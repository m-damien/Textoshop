He frequently skips school to play or go swimming. When Polly catches him sneaking home late on a Friday evening, she makes him whitewash her fence the next day as punishment.

Tom persuades several neighbourhood children to trade him small trinkets and treasures for the "privilege" of doing his work, using reverse psychology to convince them of its enjoyable nature. Later, Tom trades the trinkets with students in his Sunday school class for tickets, given out for memorizing verses of Scripture. He collects enough tickets to earn a prized Bible from the teacher, despite being one of the worst students in the class and knowing almost nothing of Scripture.
                                
Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a girl who is new in town. Tom wins the admiration of her father, the prominent Judge Thatcher, in the church by obtaining the Bible as a prize, but reveals his ignorance when he cannot answer basic questions about Scripture. Tom pursues Becky, eventually persuading her to get "engaged" by kissing her. Their romance soon collapses when she discovers that Tom was "engaged" to another schoolgirl, Amy Lawrence.` }],

Inside, they eagerly expected to find glittering gold and precious jewels, but instead, to their utter surprise and disbelief, they uncovered only a handful of tarnished ancient coins, a dusty locket, and an old manuscript, far from the riches they had imagined.
